	<h1>Time, space and Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a key concept in computer science that measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. It allows us to assess how efficient an algorithm is, especially as the size of the input grows. By evaluating time complexity, we can compare the efficiency of different algorithms and choose the most optimal one for a specific problem. In competitive programming and software development, understanding time complexity is essential for writing code that runs quickly and scales well with larger inputs.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires relative to the size of its input. Just like time complexity, understanding <b>space complexity </b>is crucial for evaluating an algorithmâ€™s efficiency, particularly when dealing with memory constraints. It is expressed in Big O notation, such as O(n), where "n" typically represents the input size. An algorithm with <b>space complexity </b> O(n), for example, would use memory proportional to the input size, which is important when optimizing for both speed and memory usage in a program.</p>
