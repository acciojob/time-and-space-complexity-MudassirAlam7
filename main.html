    <h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity is a key concept in computer science that measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. It allows us to assess how <em>efficient</em> an algorithm is, especially as the size of the input grows. By evaluating time complexity, we can compare the efficiency of different algorithms and choose the most optimal one for a specific problem.</p>

    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires relative to the size of its input. Just like time complexity, understanding <b>Space Complexity</b> is crucial for evaluating an algorithmâ€™s efficiency, particularly when dealing with memory constraints. It is expressed in Big O notation, such as <em>O(n)</em>, where "n" typically represents the input size.</p>
