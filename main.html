    <h1>Understanding Time, Space and  Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity refers to the computational complexity that describes the amount of time it takes to run an algorithm. It helps in understanding how efficient an algorithm is, especially as the input size grows.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. It is important to evaluate how an algorithm scales in terms of memory. A common way to express space complexity is using Big O notation, such as O(n).</p>
